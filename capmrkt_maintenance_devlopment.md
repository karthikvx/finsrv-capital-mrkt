### **Development Tasks**

#### **1\. Microservice Development (Python & Java)**

Developers create the producer and consumer microservices. This involves:

* **Defining Event Schemas**: Establishing a standardized format (like JSON or Avro) for the trade events to ensure all services can understand the data.  
* **Producer Logic**: Writing Python code to connect to Azure Event Hubs, serialize trade data, and handle event publishing. This service needs to be robust and handle retries if the event hub is temporarily unavailable.  
* **Consumer Logic**: Developing the Spring Boot microservice with virtual threads to consume events from Event Hubs. This service performs the business logic:  
  * **Enrichment**: Calling external APIs or querying a database to fetch portfolio metadata.  
  * **Risk Calculation**: Implementing the business logic to calculate the preliminary risk score.  
  * **Storage**: Using the Azure Storage SDK to write the enriched and scored data as a Parquet file to ADLS.

#### **2\. Data Pipeline & Snowflake Development (SQL & Python)**

Data engineers and analysts develop the data pipelines and analytics layer within Snowflake. This includes:

* **External Table Creation**: Defining the schema for the **external tables** that point to the Parquet files in ADLS.  
* **Stream and Task Creation**: Writing the SQL scripts to create a **Snowflake Stream** on the external table and a **Snowflake Task** to incrementally update a **materialized view**. This is a critical step for optimizing query performance.  
* **Dashboard Development**: Building BI dashboards that connect to the pre-aggregated materialized view for real-time analytics.

#### **3\. SRE & Observability (Azure & Python)**

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) are responsible for monitoring and alerting.

* **Alert Rule Definition**: Creating **Azure Monitor** alert rules to track key metrics like query latency in Snowflake.  
* **Automation**: Writing and deploying an **Azure Function** (in Python) that acts as a webhook to be triggered by the alert rules. This function sends notifications to the SRE team.

### **Maintenance Tasks**

#### **1\. Event-Driven System Maintenance**

* **Schema Evolution**: Managing changes to the event schema without breaking existing consumers. This often involves using a schema registry to enforce compatibility rules.  
* **Dead-Letter Queue Management**: Monitoring the dead-letter queues in Event Hubs to handle events that fail to be processed, and developing a process to re-process or discard them.  
* **Latency Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the end-to-end latency from trade ingestion to the BI dashboard update.  
* **Scaling**: Adjusting the throughput units for Event Hubs or scaling the Spring Boot microservice instances to handle spikes in trade volume.

#### **2\. Snowflake Maintenance**

* **Performance Tuning**: Regularly analyzing Snowflake query performance and optimizing SQL code, adjusting warehouse sizes, or refining the materialized views to ensure fast dashboard load times.  
* **Cost Management**: Monitoring Snowflake credit consumption and rightsizing virtual warehouses to control costs.  
* **Data Governance**: Ensuring data in Snowflake is properly governed, with access controls and retention policies maintained according to regulatory requirements.  
* **Security**: Managing and rotating credentials, and ensuring secure access from Azure services to Snowflake.

#### **3\. Microservice and Infrastructure Maintenance**

* **Dependency Updates**: Keeping Python and Java dependencies, including the Azure SDKs, up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities and get new features.  
* **CI/CD Pipeline Management**: Maintaining automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for all microservices using tools like Azure DevOps.  
* **Resiliency Testing**: Periodically performing chaos engineering tests to ensure the system gracefully handles failures, such as a microservice crash or a temporary outage of Event Hubs.
