1. Monitoring and Observation
During the tests, Azure Monitor and Snowflake's query history are used to observe the system's behavior. The SRE team watches for specific metrics:

Microservice metrics: Were events backlogged in Event Hubs? Did the microservice restart successfully?

Data pipeline metrics: Was data processing resumed? Did the Snowflake external table and materialized view get updated correctly after the failure?

Latency metrics: Did query latency in Snowflake spike due to a data gap?

2. Analysis and Remediation
After the test, the team analyzes the results to see if the system behaved as hypothesized. If it didn't, remediation tasks are created. For example, if the system didn't automatically recover, a new task might be created to implement a more robust health check and restart mechanism for the microservice.
